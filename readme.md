# C Compiler using PHP

This is a simple C Compiler implemented using PHP. It allows users to input C code, which is then compiled and executed using the system's C compiler. The output or compilation errors are displayed to the user.

## Prerequisites

To use this C Compiler, you need the following:

- PHP (version 5.4 or later)
- A C compiler installed on the system (e.g., GCC)

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure that PHP is installed on your system. You can check the PHP version by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```shell
   php -v
Start a web server that supports PHP and configure it to serve the repository directory. For example, if you're using the built-in PHP web server, navigate to the repository directory in the terminal and run the following command:

shell
Copy code
php -S localhost:8000
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/. You should see the C Compiler app interface.

In the textarea, enter your desired C code.

Click the "Compile and Run" button to compile and execute the C code.

The output of the compiled program or any compilation errors will be displayed on the web page.

Modify the code and repeat steps 5-7 as needed

This project was inspired by the need for a simple C Compiler implementation using PHP. Thanks to the developers and contributors of PHP, GCC, and other open-source tools and libraries used in this project.

Feel free to customize this README file based on your specific implementation and requirements. Provide clear instructions on how to use the compiler and any necessary configuration. Include any additional information or considerations that are relevant to your implementation.

## Security Considerations
Running arbitrary code provided by users can pose security risks. It is important to take appropriate precautions to prevent unauthorized access and malicious code execution. Consider implementing the following measures:

Input Validation: Validate and sanitize the user's input to ensure it conforms to the expected format and prevent code injection attacks.

Sandbox Environment: Execute the compiled code in a restricted and isolated environment to mitigate potential security risks.

User Permissions: Set appropriate permissions on the files and directories used by the compiler to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
