#C Compiler using PHP

This is a simple C Compiler implemented using PHP. It allows users to input C code, which is then compiled and executed using the system's C compiler. The output or compilation errors are displayed to the user.

#Prerequisites

To use this C Compiler, you need the following:

PHP (version 5.4 or later)
A C compiler installed on the system (e.g., GCC)
#Usage

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Ensure that PHP is installed on your system. You can check the PHP version by running the following command in the terminal:
shell
Copy code
php -v
Open the compiler_app.php file in a text editor and verify the following configuration:
If necessary, update the path to the C compiler in the $compilerCommand variable. By default, it is set to "gcc".
Start a web server that supports PHP. For example, you can use PHP's built-in web server by running the following command in the terminal:
shell
Copy code
php -S localhost:8000
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/compiler_app.php (replace localhost:8000 with the appropriate URL if you're using a different web server or port).
You will see a web page with a textarea to enter C code. Input your desired C code in the textarea.
Click the "Compile and Run" button to compile and execute the C code.
The output of the compiled program or any compilation errors will be displayed on the web page.
Security Considerations

Running arbitrary code provided by users can pose security risks. It is important to take appropriate precautions to prevent unauthorized access and malicious code execution. Consider implementing the following measures:

Input Validation: Validate and sanitize the user's input to ensure it conforms to the expected format and prevent code injection attacks.
Sandbox Environment: Execute the compiled code in a restricted and isolated environment to mitigate potential security risks.
User Permissions: Set appropriate permissions on the files and directories used by the compiler to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
Limitations

This C Compiler implementation has certain limitations:

It relies on an existing C compiler installed on the system (e.g., GCC). Ensure that the C compiler is properly installed and accessible.
It is a simplified implementation intended for learning purposes and may not handle all complex C language features or advanced compiler optimizations.
The compiler output may not provide detailed error messages for all types of compilation errors. Consider enhancing the error handling and reporting based on specific requirements.
